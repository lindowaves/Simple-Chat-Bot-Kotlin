### **Kotlin Learning Project**

This repository serves as a learning project for the Kotlin programming language. The goal is to explore and practice various Kotlin concepts through the creation of a simple interactive bot.

### **Project Structure**

The project consists of a single Kotlin file, `bot.kt`, containing the following functions:

* **greet:** Introduces the bot and provides its creation year.
* **remindName:** Prompts the user for their name and provides a personalized greeting.
* **guessAge:** Attempts to guess the user's age based on user-provided remainders.
* **count:** Counts from 0 to a specified number provided by the user.
* **test:** Presents a multiple-choice question related to programming methods and evaluates the user's response.
* **end:** Provides a final greeting and concludes the interaction.

### **Usage**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use a Kotlin compiler or IDE to run the `bot.kt` file.
3. Follow the prompts provided by the bot to interact with it.

### **Learning Objectives**

This project aims to reinforce the following Kotlin concepts:

* **Functions:** Defining and calling functions with parameters and return values.
* **Variables:** Declaring and assigning values to variables.
* **Input/Output:** Reading user input using the `Scanner` class and printing output to the console.
* **Control Flow:** Using conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for).
* **Basic Arithmetic:** Performing calculations and using operators.

### **Future Enhancements**
Potential future enhancements for this project include:

* Expanding the bot's functionality with additional features or interactions.
* Implementing error handling and validation for user input.
* Exploring object-oriented programming concepts in Kotlin.
* Integrating with external libraries or APIs.
